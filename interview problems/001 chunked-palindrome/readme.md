# Google | Onsite | Chunked Palindrome

Normal palindrome is defined as a string that reads the same backwards as forwards, for example "abccba".

Chunked palindrome is defined as a string that you can split into chunks and it will form a palindrome.

For example, "volvo". You can split it into (vo)(l)(vo). Let A = "vo", B = "l", so the original string is ABA which is a palindrome.

Given a string str, find the maximum number of chunks we can split that string to get a chuncked palindrome.

## Examples

### Example 1

Input: "valve"

Output: 1

Explanation: You can't split it into multiple chunks so just return 1 (valve)

### Example 2

Input: "voabcvo"

Output: 3

Explanation: (vo)(abc)(vo)

### Example 3

Input: "vovo"

Output: 2

Explanation: (vo)(vo)

### Example 4

Input: "volvolvo"

Output: 5

Explanation: (vo)(l)(vo)(l)(vo)

### Example 5

Input: "volvol"

Output: 2

Explanation: (vol)(vol)

### Example 6

Input: "aaaaaa"

Output: 6

Explanation: We can split it into (aaa)(aaa), but the optimal split should be (a)(a)(a)(a)(a)(a)
